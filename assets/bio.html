<h1 class="heading-1">Bio</h1>
<div class="bio-cont"><p class="bioparagraph">Hilding is a Swedish songwriter based in Berlin. His music is a blend of modern pop and classic rock, filtered through his bedroom studio where his heartfelt bangers are mostly recorded. Classic bands like INXS and the replacements, peek through modern production in songs full of euphoria and regret. Having grown up religious in Sweden, he ended up in Berlin after quitting med school and drifting around northern Europe.Â 

    In its own way, Berlin features as a character in his songs, with its grey concrete winter and summertime abandon. His debut album "Love Songs For The End of Time" is a portrait of broken people who can only stand to be beautiful for one night. He recorded it alone, tracking nearly all the instruments himself in his home studio and his rehearsal space. The songs tell a story of a boy falling in love with the city, as well as serving as a flashback of a man who has been through too much. Hilding is simultaneously the small town rube with stars in his eyes, as well as the broken down wanderer who has seen it all before.
